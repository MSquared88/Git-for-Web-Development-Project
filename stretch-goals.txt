Merge Conflict: 

A merge conflict is when two developers have worked on the same project modify the same line of code and
and when they commit there work there is a conflict.

To fix a conflict git will give you a merge conflict error message 
and will display the conflict in your code it will look something like this 

1 <<<<<<<<<<HEAD
2  (this is your line of code
3 ===============
	(this is the conflict code)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Origin/(wherever the conflict code came from)

to fix a merge conflict you must collaberate with the other dev and chose wich line/lines of code that need 
to be kept and then delete the other code and add commit and push the code back upstream.
